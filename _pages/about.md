I am pursuing a Masters degree in Business Analytics at UT Austin’s McCombs School of Business. I’d love to share a short story before I get to the good part:

"A mother was teaching a child how to dive at a local swimming pool and the child was very frightened. He stood at the edge, repeating: “I can’t! I can’t! I’m scared!” So, the mom said: “Be scared, but jump in anyway!”

Now, as a student who joined a graduate course right after my undergraduate degree in chemical engineering, the experiences I have had are intimidating and new. They make me want to stay firmly on the ground and sometimes, they even make me feel like calling my mom. However, after leading two of the biggest teams on campus during my undergraduate degree, after being one of the the youngest members of my graduate class with 66 people and after jumping head-first into the world of data science without any significant coding knowledge or expertise I have started to really appreciate, and almost enjoy the feeling of being terrified but jumping in anyway!

I am currently on a mission to continuously improve my technical skills in the field of data science and analytics and combine them with my interpersonal skills and business knowledge to solve complex problems.

I look forward to working with a world-class analytics team in the future and if there is an opening in your team and you are solving problems using data, I am interested!
